This so far is the first iteration of VM with [treehouse-builder](https://github.com/ole-vi/treehouse-builder) so also non-Linux sytems can play with raspberry pi image modifications

```
git clone https://github.com/ole-vi/ole--vagrant-treehouses.git
cd ole--vagrant-treehouses
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
screen -x
```
to see building process messages

new image will be created at `image` directory
